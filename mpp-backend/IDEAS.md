Pals:
- Should pals allow groups? Or just 2 users?
- Some sort of superpal option for those who've exchanged loads of messages

Users:
- Need some sort of display name validation for bad words
- How should we display birthdays? (Right now the timestamp is returned)

Design:
- How should the mappings be stored (i.e. user -> pals -> messages)? Right now they're code but maybe there should be some sort of IDs/PK/FK relation?

Messages:
- Reactions to messages? Depends on postcards versus virtual
